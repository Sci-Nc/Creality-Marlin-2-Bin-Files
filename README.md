# creality Firmware: Bin Files For Easier Install
Open source firmware from TH3d.com compiled into bin format for easier install.




Instructions:
1. Download Zip and extract the required file onto an empty SD card that you know is working
2. Power off the 3D printer and unplug the usb cord 
3. Insert the Sd card that has your file
4. Power on the 3D printer and wait for the file to install automatically
5. After the boot screen loads power off the 3D printer and remove the sd card
6. erase the file from your SD card before you use it

After Install:
Reset your EEPROM. If you don't the settings may not work correctly
Double check that your Axis and Extruder steps are correct and report any problems to https://github.com/Sci-Nc  so that I can fix the firmware for everyone.
